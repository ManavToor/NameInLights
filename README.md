<h1>Name In Lights</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Assignment in highschool tech class. Ojective was to spell your name in LEDs with Arduino. It was to show that you are limited by the amount of output pins on the arduino, and you can't place too many LEDs on each pin or else you will overdraw current. I however already knew a thing or too about Arduino's, so I had a work around :p. This is made in TinkerCAD because we were virtual during covid<br />
<br />
<b>This is LED matrix:</b><br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-1x3 LED display that can display up to 3 characters in 7x5 resolution<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-a character can be inputed into the serial monitor and will be displayed on the display<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-a button to turn on and off the display<br />
<br />
I made this all by myself! (However I did watch tutorials on how to use some of the components, I linked all my help in the comments of the code)<br />
